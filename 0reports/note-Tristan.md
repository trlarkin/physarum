24 April Findings
-----------------
Using the paper I determined settings that promote the development of a network connecting food sources. The important settings are:

```go
width:              1<<9
height:             1<<9
numParticles:       1<<17
blurRadius:         1
blurPasses:         2
zoomFactor:         1

SensorAngle:        Radians(45),
SensorDistance:     8,
RotationAngle:      Radians(45),
StepDistance:       1,
DepositionAmount:   2,
DecayFactor:        0.05,
```
